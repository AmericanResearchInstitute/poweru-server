History:

- The 'payflowpro' module had support for Express Checkout in r3424, which was
then removed.  However, it is buggy, and it was never able to be tested.  But,
if a future customer wants this feature, it may be easier to start here.  A
known issue as of this time is that the 'Transaction' XML structure is missing.

Tips for writing merchant services modules:

- Instantiate a pr_logging.raw_response object right before
executing a transaction.  That way if there is a database
error, an exception will be raised, thus preventing the
transaction.  Call it's enter() method right after receiving
a response.  If a database error occurs here, it will be
handled silently, allowing processing to continue.
