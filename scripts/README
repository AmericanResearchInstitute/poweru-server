Most of what has been in this directory historically have been scripts that are
run by cron.  With the addition of celery into our product cron is mostly, if
not completely obsolete.  So this directory will start to shrink over time.

Coincidentally, the scripts to manager a celeryd process can also be found
here.  There is currently no celery package for Debian and there appears to be
no plan to include it.  Since we're moving towards using PIP and
python-virtualenv for our deployments, celery will be installed into those
virtual envionrments with PIP.  The celery init scripts can then be placed in
/etc/init.d/ and configured with /etc/default/celeryd, etc.

We have future plans to make our own Debian package with a customized version
of these init scripts to support multiple celery daemons per host with
disparate task bases (e.g. different web sites).
